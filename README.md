# Heaith-care-management-systems
Developed a Java-based Healthcare Management System to manage patients, doctors, and appointments efficiently.
Applied OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) for modular, reusable code with separate classes for Patient, Doctor, and Appointment.
Implemented input validation, exception handling, and used ArrayList / HashMap for fast data storage, retrieval, and updates.
Followed clean coding practices, optimized algorithms for search/sort, and tested extensively to ensure reliability.
The project enhanced my Java skills, problem-solving, and code optimization abilities while delivering a scalable and user-friendly system.
